# `THE MOVIE DATABASE _ REACT JS`
First project for trying out React JS.
It is a simple web app to browse through movies for overview and cast and crew.
Followed [FreeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTeuhbP7wdE). It is beginner friendly, clear and easy to follow.

### `HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT ?`
Clone the repo and run the command `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
Set up the `.env` file with the API key form [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) just like shown in `.env.example`
Finally `npm start` will get the server running.
